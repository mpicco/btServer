btServer
========

Bluetooth server for testing communication with Glass.

This is a work in progress.  Presently, it does not accept a second connection, so when you run it, your test client can only connect once.  After that you have to restart the server.

This just sends the current date string to the client once a second.  Once this is working solidly, I plan to integrate it into a Torque plugin to send OBD data to Glass.

I'm new to Android, so any help would be appreciated :-)
